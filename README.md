# Personal Wesbite

I'm going to use this as my landing page to point to various elements online where you can access my content and information.

## Technology

This is super simple. It's hosted on Github Pages (dope cause it's free).
It is also a plain and simple HTML only website. No CSS. No JS. Simple HTML. 
This makes it fast and able to render everywhere. Dope.
